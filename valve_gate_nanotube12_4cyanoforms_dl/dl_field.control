Types of solvent available:
TIP3P_O - Original TIP3P
TIP3P_C - TIP3P model, flexible bond (CHARMM-specific, AMBER, OPLSAA). 
TIP3P_E - TIP3P water model optimised for ewald sum.
TIP4P   - TIP4P water model (one pseudo point).
TIP5P   - Five-site water model (two pseudo points).
TIP5P_E - Five site water model optimised for ewald sum.
MeOH    - Methanol, obtained from CHARMM FF
IPA     - Propan-2-ol, isopropyl alcohol, obtained from CHARMM FF
THF	- Tetrahydrofuran, obtained from CHARMM FF
(please see solvent/solvent_list file for more solvent choices)

Note: 
(1) When apply CONSTRAIN directives (either h-bond or all) to water, all bonds 
    in water will be constrained BUT not the angle. So the water molecules
    are still somewhat flexible.
    If rigid_water is used, the H-H, in addition to O-H bonds, will be 
    constrained.

(2) If the group_name cannot be matched in the user's configuration file
    the select atom command will be ignored.

(3) The third data column for TETHER directive is the spring constant.

(4) the user-defined forcefield file (UDFF) contain BOTH user-defined structure
    and potential parameters information. This prevent users from tampering
    with the standard DL_FIELD potential library file.
    UDFF is where you can insert new models and new potential parameters. 
    In addition, existing atom types and/or potential parameterscan also be 
    redefined in UDFF file. This will OVERRIDE any existing data in the 
    standard library files of a chosen potential scheme.
    The dl_field.user is an example of a user-defined forcefield file.
    This must be renamed as DL_FIELD.udff
    DO NOT use any of the examples in the file for your work. 

(5) If periodic image convention is NOT selected (0), then cell vectors will be 
    ignored. Any other number indicate type of simulation box (defined as imcon
    in DL_POLY manual)
    1 = Cubic box (D,0,0), (0,D,0), (0,0,D)
    2 = Orthorhombic (D,0,0), (0,E,0), (0,0,F)
    3 = Parallelepiped (La1,La2,La3), (Mb1,Mb2,Mb3),(Nc1,Mc2,Nc3) 
    6 = Slab (periodic in x,y but NOT z).
    Any other types are not available in DL_FIELD.

(6) 1-4 scalings,x. 
    For example, 1-4 Coulombic = coulombic*x

(7) Epsilon and sigma mixing rule: only applicable to LJ12-6. 
    Recommended setting is default because different FF may have different rules.

(8) Solution Maker.
    Cutoff specifies minimum distance between molecules. Adjust this value to make
    molecules more spread out. If not all molecules can be fitted in a given
    box size, reduce the density or decrease the cutoff values.
    Equilibration is required (using DL_POLY) once the model is set up.
    Units recognised: kg/m^3, g/cm^3, mol/dm^3, molecules 

(9) VDW LJ 12-6 mixing rule options for epsilon and sigma:
    1 = standard geometric
    2 = standard arithmatic
    3 = Fender-Halsey
    4 = Halgren HHG
    
    For Lorentz-Berthelot rules, set epsilon = 1 and sigma = 2
    For Hogervorst (good hope), set epsilon = 1 and sigma = 1
